# California Housing Price Prediction

Welcome to the California Housing Price Prediction project! This project aims to predict the median housing price in various districts in California based on a set of features, including population and median income. We'll use machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, to build a predictive model.

## Project Overview

The California Housing Price Prediction project is based on the California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository. Although the dataset is not recent, it serves as an excellent resource for learning machine learning concepts. We'll create a model that can predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other available features.

## Project Steps

1. **Loading the Data:** We start by loading the dataset, getting it ready for analysis.

2. **Creating the Test Set:** We create a test set to evaluate the model's performance.

3. **Data Exploration:** Visualizing the data helps us understand the relationships between different features and their correlations with the target variable.

4. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Data quality is crucial. We'll clean the data and handle missing values.

5. **Feature Selection:** We determine which features are most relevant for the prediction task.

6. **Custom Transformers:** We develop custom transformers for specific data transformations.

7. **Transformation Pipelines:** Pipelines help streamline data processing and model training.

8. **Model Training:** We train the predictive model using three different algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.

9. **Fine Tuning:** We fine-tune the model's hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearch.

10. **Model Analysis:** We analyze the best model's performance and consider insights gained from the process.

11. **Evaluation on Test Set:** We evaluate the final model on the test set to assess its real-world performance.

12. **Model Persistence:** Once we have a satisfactory model, we save it for future use.
